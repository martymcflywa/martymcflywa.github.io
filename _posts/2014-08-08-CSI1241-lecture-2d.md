# Teamwork

## Introduction

If you work in IT, you will certainly need to work in teams. Team exercises occur throughout the degree in preparation for working in the IT industry.

- While the size of projects may vary, the reality is that most projects need more than one person because:
	- The deadline is so tight that one person can't complete the whole project in time
	- It is rare that one person will have all the skills and competencies required

There are downsides to working in teams:

- Communication between teams is an added burden
- Coordination between team members takes time and is an additional task
- Politics, conflict and different standards, agendas and expectations make teams less effective
- The number of lines of communication in team grows as additional members are added
- What are the number of possible communication paths for:
	- 1 person team
	- 2 person team
	- 3 persom team
	- 4 person team
- The formula is: `n(n-1)/2`

## Team

- A team is more than just a collective of individuals
- A team is formed from a group when individuals put the group before themselves
	- The team then becomes highly effective at getting the job done
	- When people come together and make the whole greater than the sum of the parts

## People Problems

- Team members do not work together efficiently
- Conflicts result in
	- Poor communication
	- Poor designs
	- Interface errors
	- Extra work
- Problem team members not removed from team
- Most qualified personnel not available
- Most qualified personnel not used
- Key personnel are available only part time
- People's assignments do not match their strengths
- Members leave before the project is complete
- Low motivation and morale reduce productivity

### Warning Signs

- "I don't need anyone to review my code"
- "No one else can fix the bugs in my code"
	- "I am too busy to fix them now, but i'll get to them next week"
- "I still think we ought to go back and change the design we were talking about last month"
- "No one tells us anything and we get most of our information from the grapevine"
- "It's just another job with people telling us what to do"
- "I don't know how to explain my design, I just know that it works"
- "My code is too complicated to test"

### Know Thyself First

- In order to perform well in a team, you have to know yourself first
- Otherwise you won't understand how your behaviour affects others and how you can fit into a team
- To begin with, there must be:
	- Self reflection of goals
	- Self knowledge of strengths and weaknesses
	- Self appreciation of skills and behaviour within a team, especially at critical times
- Next stage is to observe what effects your behaviour and actions have on other team members:
	- If you are late to a meeting, how are you treated?
	- Was the treatment reasonable?
	- How did you react to the treatment?

## Characteristics of a Good Team

- Shared vision
- Team identity
- Results driven
- Committed
- Competent
- Trust
- Empowerment
- High level of enjoyment and satisfaction

## Benefits to Organisation

- Produce high standard of work
- Significantly reduce costs over unproductive teams
- Reduce absenteeism and employee turnover
- Develop individuals for more responsible positions
- Individual motivation is enhanced thus increasing productivity to organisation
- Increased participating and involvement in problem solving
- Improved organisational representation in problem solving
	- Cross section of skills experience and attitudes
- Increased commitment to implementing solutions

## Team Issues

- Can initially take more time to implement
- Require additional training to be effective
- Increased complexity of decision making process
- New roles of participants have to be learned
- Peer group pressure can exert strong influence

### Stages of Individual Commitment

- If you find you need to motivate an individual team member, you will find they go through 3 stages of commitment
	1. Engage
		- Stimulate their interest
		- Getting them to understand significance or consequences of inaction
	2. Align
		- Understanding their role and tasks in relation to others
	3. Commit
		- To desired action

## Team Developmental Stages

- Forming
	- Where people are trying to learn about
		- Others in the team
		- The goals
		- Their possible roles within it
- Storming
	- People vie for
		- Positions
		- Roles
		- Status
- Norming
	- Where people settle down to get the job done
- Performing
	- Team begins to act as one and starts to achieve goals

## Contract

A contract between team members is a good way of getting people to commit to what they will be obligated to do and to understand what consequences may eventuate before the project work begins.

- A contract is an agreement between team members that details:
	- The roles that each is expected to undertake
	- The standards expected by the group
		- Punctuality
		- Informing of non-attendance
	- The consequences of not meeting to agreed standards

## Review

- Why is a team better than a group of individuals?
	- A team is formed from a group when individuals put the group before themselves
	- The team then becomes highly effective at getting the job done
	- When people come together and make the whole greater than the sum of the parts
- What are the three stages of individual commitment?
	- Engage
	- Align
	- Commit
- What are the four stages of team formation?
	- Forming
	- Storming
	- Norming
	- Performing
- Define:
	- Minutes template
		- A template for writing minutes at meetings
	- Team contract
		- Getting team members to commit to what they will be obligated to do and to understand the consequences when those obligations are not met
	- Agenda
		- Outlines the meeting objective
