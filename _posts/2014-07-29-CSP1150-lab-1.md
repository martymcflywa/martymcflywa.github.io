# Getting Familiar with Java

#### Source for these completed exercises can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/martymcflywa/ecu/tree/master/year_1/sem_1/CSP1150_programming_principles/01_week_1/PrintCharlie/src) repo.

## Self Assessment

There will be small programming tasks to complete at most workshops. See unit schedule to find out which weeks have *assessable* workshops. For these in-class tasks, you can work with other students and help each other, and can ask the tutor for help.

### Submission:

In the weeks with asssessable workshops, you **must** submit your work, using the relevant links in the [Assessment](http://blackboard.ecu.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_604950_1&content_id=_3450096_1&mode=reset) area of Blackboard. After the deadline, example solutions will be available.

### Assessment:

When the submission deadline has passed, you will be able to assess your own submission.

Each assessment will be for a maximum of 2 marks, and you can earn up to 15 marks in total. For example, if you submit 9 assessments and score 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2 (total 12) you will get 12 marks. If your total is more than 15, you will get 15 marks.

The remainder of your workshop assessment marks come from a programming assignment, to be submitted later in the semester.

**Note:** No external help is allowed for the assignment, ie. No help from friends, fellow students or internet.
