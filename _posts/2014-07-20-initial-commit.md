I decided I needed to start a blog to leave myself notes about stuff I've come across that has helped me in some way regarding programming or web development. I am also just about to start uni in the next couple of weeks and thought having some place to collect my thoughts would be really handy. I plan on posting my class notes here as well so that I can refer to them easier and have them available anywhere.

I only recently heard about Jekyll while watching videos on the [DevTips] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ) channel and thought I'd take a look. I'm digging how quickly I can add snippets of code, either with markdown or with [Gist] (http://gist.github.com/), and that free hosting is available on [GitHub Pages] (https://pages.github.com/). I also like the idea of posting content via a text editor rather than using something like Wordpress, which I think would be overkill for what I want to achieve with this blog. I also like the fact that I have to use [GitHub] (http://github.com) to commit my posts, so I can get more practice using git.

Anyway that's it for my first post, more stuff about stuff to follow.
