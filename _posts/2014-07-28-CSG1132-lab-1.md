Most of the tasks for this lab involved setting up [PebblePad](http://www.pebblelearning.co.uk/) which I think completely **blows** by the way. It's slow and it's clunky. Probably because the whole thing is based on Flash. Didn't think any sites used that anymore. Plus all the layouts are pretty limited. Lucky I got this blog right?

Anyway, we had to create some concept maps for reasons that promote or detract user motivation in [Fakebook](https://www.facebook.com/). Shouldn't be too hard to tell which side of the fence I sit on.
