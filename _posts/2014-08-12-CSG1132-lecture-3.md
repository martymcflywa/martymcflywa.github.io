## Pathways to Knowledge

- Knowledge can be sought (Jackson, 2006) by:
	- Superstition
	- Intuition
	- Authority
	- Tenacity
	- Rationalism
		- Knowledge gained by reasoning
			- Deductive reasoning
			- Students are good people, Jane is a good student, therefore Jane is a good person
		- Empiricism
			- Gaining knowledge through observation of organisms and events in the real world
			- Inductive reasoning
		- Science
			- Combining both rationalism and empiricism

## Communication and Knowledge

### What is Academic Research?

#### Blind Alley Frame:

>*Research* is the process of going up alleys to see if they are 'blind' (Marston Bates, 1906-174)

#### Bad Hair Day Frame:

>Real research is often confusing, messy, intensely frustrating and fundamentally non-linear (Marshall & Rossman, 1995 in Williamson, 2002, pp. 7)

#### Rigour and Discipline Frame:

>Research can be described as a highly conscious, formal process that uses rigour and discipline to examine and intepret our environment and the activities of the human beings who inhabit our world (Williamson, 2002; Pickard, 2007)

#### KISS Frame:

>Research is defined as the "systematic investigation into and study of materials, sources, etc., in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions" (Thompson, 1996)

#### Men in White Coats Frame:

>Research... is an organised, systematic, data-based, critical, scientific inquiry or investigation into a specific problem, undertaken with the objective of finding answers or solutions to it (Sekeran, 1992 in Williamson, 2002, pp. 6)

#### Quest for Understanding Frame:

>For the social scientist or researcher in applied fields, research is a process of trying to gain a better understanding of human interactions. Through systematic means, the researcher gathers information about actions and interactions, and reflects on their meaning, arrives at and evaluates conclusions, and eventually puts forward an interpretation (Marshall & Rossman, 1995 in Williamson, 2002, pp. 6)

### Academic Research

Most frames share a common perception of academic research as:

- A form of argumentation
- Rigorous
	- Thorough
- Evidence based
- Repeatable
	- Findings able to be validated
- Qualified by other sources
	- Other research literature
- Something that adds to the current body of knowledge

## Argumentation

- When conducting research and to strengthen / uphold your argument, you need to provide:
	- Supporting evidence from other research
		- Secondary / tertiary sources
		- Rationalism
	- Conclusive primary evidence
		- Scientific method
	- Or both
- Two basic methods of argument
	- Induction
	- Deduction

### Induction

>Induction reasoning starts from specific observations or sensory experiences and then develops a general conclusion from them (Walliman, 2011).

### Deduction

>Deductive reasoning begins with general statements (premise) and through logical argument, comes to a specific conclusion (Walliman, 2011).

### Induction or Deduction?

#### The Area of a Circle

- Can we derive a formula that describes the area of the circle?
	- **IF** the perimeter of a circle `p` is given by the formula `p = 2ɸr` and the area of the triangle is given by `a_t = ½ bh`
	- **THEN** if we have a very large number of triangles, the area of a circle `a_c` can be described by:

```
a_c = ½ (2ɸr) x r
a_c = ɸr2
```

#### Exercises

- Decide if the following questions are best suited to inductive or deductive reasoning:
	- A: What is the relationship between Type 2 diabetes and obesity?
		- Deduction
	- B: The size of the angle described by B in the diagram on `pp. 4`
		- Deduction
	- C: How could a baby fall out of a twenty-story building onto the ground and live?
		- Induction
	- D: Can frequent activity breaks improve the health of people who sit for long periods?
		- Induction

### The Role of Authority and Verifiability

- There are three basic requirements for the presentation of evidence in support of a claim in academic research:
	- A: The literature we use to support arguments must be authoritative and accessible to anyone who wants to check the basis of a claim
	- B: Evidence in the form of observations and findings must be verifiable through repitition
	- C: All evidence must be fully acknowledged in terms of intellectual ownership
- In academic research, **referencing** is used in the presentation of argument that relies (wholly or in part) on scholarly literature to support a claim:
	- Referencing allows the reader
		- To check that literature used in support or claim has been used properly
		- To find easily a range of sources on the topic area to further improve their knowledge
- Hence in university assignments, you must demonstrate the depth and breadth of your research by in-text referencing and including an end of text reference list

## Referencing

Referencing is a requirement in all your academic work. It is a formal way to let your readers know exactly where you found your information and acknowledges other authors' words and ideas that you have used in your own work.

- There are two kinds of references:
	- In-text
		- Is embedded into the argument
	- End-text
		- Appears in a list of all references at the end of the text
- Guidelines
	- Format references as per the University Standard
		- APA 6th
		- Use ECU Referencing Guide for all references for which you are unsure
	- Use for attributing ideas as well as with quotes
		- So that intellectual ownership is acknowledged
	- Each in-text citation must have a matching end-text reference
	- Do not add works to the end of the text list for which there is no matching in-text reference
		- Making it look as if you have read more than you actually have is deceit

## Authority

The concept of **peer review** means that a source has been reviewed by the researcher community via an editorial process before being accepted for publication. Note that a *prima facie* only assures that the stuff is good.

Work that has not been subjected to this process is thought to may be less reliable or even false.

>A lie repeated often enough will be considered to be the truth

> J. Goebbels

### Google Scholar

- Citation is also used as a measure of authority and scholarly value
	- A citation is a reference to a published or unpublished work
	- If a work is cited often, then authority and value are greater
	- Use [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com.au/) to check for citations

## Voice

>Research is a process that involves not only data gathering, but also analysis and interpretation

>Dirks, A (2005)

It is important that the reader can *hear* your voice.

- Your voice means:
	- Doing the research reading
	- Gathering the data
	- Interpreting this information
	- Using it to answer or support your research question/s
	- Support and qualify your thesis statement
- You can use a direct quote from someone else's work, but only if this is the best way to get your point across
	- In doing so, the quote must be properly attributed

>According to Jones (2012, p.54) there "is a growning vulnerability in users to phishing scams"

- Writing your own words indicates how well you have understood, interpreted and analysed data collected on the topic
	- You must demonstrate your understandings by using your own words

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism means to knowingly or unknowingly present as one's own work the ideas of writings of another without appropriate acknowledgement or referencing. This includes, but not limited to:

- Paraphrasing or copying text without the acknowledgement of the source
- Copying, whether identically or in essence, the text of another student's assignment or other students' assignments
- Copying, whether identically or in essence, of visual representations (ie. cartoons, line drawings, photos, paintings and computer programs)

See [ECU Academic Misconduct](http://www.ecu.edu.au/GPPS/governance_services/resources_file/academic_misconduct_rules_students%28070327%29.pdf).

### Urban Myths

- I'll never be caught
	- The tools available for detection are extensive
- It's OK to use copied content if it is referenced
	- Who's voice am I hearing?
	- If it is copied, then it should be in quotation marks
- Paraphrasing is OK?
	- Who's voice am I hearing?
- As a first time offender, the penalty makes the risk worthwhile
	- Decisions about penalties are made by HoS and Dean
		- Is it your lucky day?
- No one will know that I have cheated my way to a degree
	- Serious academic misconduct is recorded in the Student Records Database

## Being Organised

Lecturer's personal hints:

- Always name a file using the author, date of publication and title
	- Dirks, A. (2005). Formal Research and Academic Writing
- Include complete references at the top of notes
- Reference **at the time**, finding references after assignment is finished is a chore
