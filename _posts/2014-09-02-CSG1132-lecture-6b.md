- The two presentations above are different
	- The first presentation involves ten basic errors in presentation
		- See if you can identify them
	- Organise your observations and write them down under headings of
		- Story telling
		- Slides
		- Delivery
	- The second presentation may or may not be more effective
	- Decide for yourself
	- Make further notes under the headings above

## Argumentation

Recall that argumentation is a form of communication that aims to persuade with effective reasoning based on:

- Logic
- Rhetoric
- Dialectic

Like academic writing, presentation is another way of going about argumentation

## Presentation Components

Presentations are made up of:

1. Stories
	- A logical flow of ideas and facts that makes a coherent narrative that is persuasive
2.	Slides
	- Two viewpoints
		- *Death by PowerPoint* (Garber, 2001)
		- *PowerPoint as an aid to effective presentation*
	- Three purposes
		1. Add structure
		2. Prompt
		3. Enhance the monologue
3. Delivery
	- Act of performance
	- Where connections are made at a human level and the role of technology is to frame and amplify the message and to promote recall

## Rules for effective presentation

- Schwerlty (2011) describes the following protocols or rules for effective presentations
	- Clarify your objectives
	- Brainstorm and develop a theme
	- Outline your content
	- Introduction
	- Thesis
	- Supporting evidence
	- Conclusion
	- Rehearse

## Story telling

### Effective content

>Because so much of the content we're presenting these days is so vast, so complicated, or in such grey areas, presenters often get lost in their own labyrinthine heads

- Your content must be effective and sufficient telling the audience everything it needs to know
	- Every chair in the room is filled with a person who will absorb your content and make a decision in response
		- To either go along with you
		- Or not

### Narrative and empathy

- Human beings are susceptible to and prefer story telling
	- Knowledge or information presented as a story is more likely to create a lasting impression than the same information presented as a *solution* to a *problem*
- Clever presenters display empathy with their audience and adjust their presentation accordingly
	- Undeerstand and react to your audience
	- Adjust your presentation
		- Expert knowledge
		- Fatigue
		- Demography

## Slides

- PowerPoint performs three basic functions in presentation
	- Provide structure
	- Prompt the presenter
	- Enhance the monologue
		- Graphical explanations
			- Charts
		- Visual stimulus
		- New information
		- Focus

## Slide guidelines

### Fonts and text

- Use simple sans serif fonts
	- Tahoma
		- Has a ratio of stroke width to height and letter width to height that makes it highly legible
	- Arial
	- Verdana
	- Open sans
- Don't overwhelm your audience with bells and whistles
- Use sentence case for your bullets
- Avoid overly compressed or extended texts
- Minimize the use of font embellishments

![too much text](http://i.imgur.com/x8TnrIo.png)

### Colour

- Use high-contrast text-to-background combinations
	- Contrast has a large impact on legibility
- Use dark text on light background
- Consider split complimentary colours

### Layout

- Be consistent
	- Keep aspects of your presentation such as font and colours consistent
- Line spacing should be half a character height
- Respect margins
- Follow graphic design principles for
	- Size
	- Balance
	- Contrast
	- Rhythm

### Comprehension

- Use bullets
	- Not multi line paragraphs
- Bullets should be affirmative and in active voice
- Use no more than 4 Â± 1 bullets on a slide
- Avoid distracting elements
	- Animation effects when over-used add noise and detract from comprehension

### Charts, graphs and tables

- Avoid 3D graphs
- Do not use more than five or six colours or shapes
- Preview the colour of grpahs
	- Colour shift should be expected with another laptop/projector
- Less is more as long as it is enough
	- Too much information in a chart can make it unreadable
- Position the legend to minimize information access costs

## Delivery

### Organisation

- Murphy's laws
	- Test your presentation before you show it
	- Always have a backup of your presentation on hand
	- Be prepared to do the presentation without PowerPoint
		- Professionals always print handouts for the audience
	- Know your material
	- If using the internet, make sure you have wireless or dongle backup for connection
	- Make sure you have a backup copy of your presentation if required
- Anything that can go wrong will go wrong
- There is always one more bug
- In case of doubt, make it sound convincing
- If you try to please everybody, nobody will like it
- Reconnaissance should be mandatory
	- Often you can avoid the agony of failed delivery by testing the setup on the day

### Rehearse

- A presentation must work as a piece of theatre
- Rehearse your presentation
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Face the audience not the screen
	- Make eye contact
	- Use gesture, pause and movement
- Don't read the PowerPoint presentation
	- The audience can read too
- Think of the slide as a mnemonic
	- A reminder

### Timing

- Have your timing right
	- A half hour presentation is approximately 10 to 15 slides
	- 1 slide per 2 minutes with 5 to 10 minute questions
	- A presentation of 50 slides is undeliverable
	- If content is too dense, each time the slide changes the audience will pause to read and ignore the oration
		- Content should be graspable within 10 seconds
		- Aim to keep the narrative in sync with the slides
- Keep it simple
	- PowerPoint is a tool
	- If your audience requires detail, then provide handouts

### Public speaking

- Mental preparation
- Dress appropriately
- Check your notes
- Leave time to get organised
- Adopt a confident and calm manner
- Always arrive at the venue early
- Create a presence
- Stand in an appropriate place in front of your audience
- Face them directly
- If you are confident, stand directly infront of them with your hands free to use hand gestures
- If you are a little unsure, stand behind the podium or desk to rest hands and notes

#### Creating a presence

- Maintain eye contact with audience
- Move your eyes around the room and try to cover the whole audience
- Keep a lively, focused and intelligent expression and smile when appropriate
- Look towards the back of the audience and don't actually look directly at anyone
	- You will appear to be making eye contact

#### Being heard

- Speak slowly, clearly and loudly
- Use a modulated tone of voice
	- Not monotone
- Emphasise important points
- Pause after a key point, or before one
- Project your voice from your lungs and breathe normally
	- Sometimes when we are nervous we hold our breath

#### Maintain interest

- Use exclamations and rhetorical devices such as
	- A personal address
	- An anecdote
	- One word sentences
	- Questions
- Break up your presentation with images or multimedia
	- Make sure they are relevant
- Be passionate
- Pitch your talk to your audience
- Stick to your time limit
- Let your personality come through
- Try to connect with your audience
- Sound as though you mean it
