## Parking Lot

- A list of concepts waiting to be connected
- Should occur at the start before the concept map is constructed
	- Need to try this

## Helpful Tips

- Important to begin with a domain of knowledge that is familiar
	- Create context to help determine the heirarchical structure
- Construct a **focus question**
	- Every concept map responds to a focus question
	- Leads to a richer concept map
	- Use the question to define scope, do not deviate
	- Ask the *right* questions
- Identify key concepts that apply to domain
	- 15 - 25 concepts
	- List the concepts
	- Rank concepts in an ordered list
	- Most general, inclusive concepts at the top
	- Least general, exclusive concepts at the bottom
	- Order may change as map develops, but useful as starting point
	- Referred to as the **parking lot**
	- Concepts may remain in parking lot if no useful connection is found

- Construct preliminary concept map
	- Use Cmap so concepts can be moved around
	- Revise map as often as possible
	- Add other concepts
- After preliminary concept map is finished
	- Look for cross-links
	- Links between different segments or domains
	- Cross-links are important to demonstrate full understanding of relationships between subdomains
- A concept map is never finished
	- Revise
	- Reposition concepts to increase clarity and structure
	- After different variations, develop a final map
- Stylize final map
	- To imrove clarity
	- Improve readability

## Pitfalls

- Recognize that all concepts are in some way related to one another
	- Be selective in identifying cross-links
	- Be precise in identifying linking words that connect concepts
- Avoid *sentences in the boxes*
	- Don't use full sentences as concepts
	- This indicates a whole subsection could be constructed by that statement
- Avoid *string maps*
	- They illustrate poor understanding
	- Also shows inadequate restructuring of the map
- May find it difficult to use words to link other concepts
	- Shows poor understanding of relationships between concepts
	- Shows poor understanding of meaning of concepts
	- Focus on good linking words
	- Identify the strongest and most useful cross-links
