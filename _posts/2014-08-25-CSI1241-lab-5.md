# Evaluating a Use Case Script

## Background

Use Case diagrams express the functions of a system in an abstract, readable way. Use Cases provide the process step detail to explain exactly how a use case succeeds. One way to learn about writing good use cases is to analyse poor ones.

## Tasks:

1. Examine the excerpts from the following use cases
2. Find the errors in the interactions
	- Re-write as necessary
3. Explain reasoning

<!--more-->

# Use Case 1:

## Use case: Log In

**Actor/s:** Client, Administrator  

## Typical Course of Events

| Actor Action | System Response |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1. Client clicks on log in button | 2. System requests identification for user |
| 3. Client enters account name and password then clicks on log in button | 4. System authenticates details by matching it with the details on the record |
|  | 5. If correct then system signs in client |

## Errors:

- Step 1 and Step 3 refers to GUI
	- Essential use cases should not make any references to GUI or technology
- Step 3 abstraction too low
- Step 4 abstraction too low
	- Too specific, too much detail of processes
- Repeated actions not modelled correctly
	- Should use one of the two repeat styles shown in lecture
- Alternative flow is incorrectly modelled
	- Should either add description of variation in alternative flow section
	- Or modify body of use case description to show alternative flow
- Is missing the following sections
	- Purpose
	- Overview
	- Preconditions
	- Postconditions
- Actor Administrator is not active in use case and should be removed

# Use Case 1 Re-write:

## Use case: Log In

**Actor/s:** Client  
**Purpose:** This use case allows client to log into the system  
**Overview:** Client logs into system and is authenticated. If authentication is failed after 3 attempts, use case ends.  
**Preconditions:** Client is logged out of system and is attempting to log in.  
**Postconditions:** Client successfully logs into system

## Typical Course of Events

| Actor Action                                             | System Response                 |

| 1. Client enters user account details                    | 2. System authenticates details |
| Until successfully logged in, or after 3 failed attempts |                                 |

# Use Case 2:

## Use case: Payment

**Actor/s:** Client  
**Overview:** This Use Case begins when the client buys the insure product

## Typical Course of Events

| Actor Action                                                                                                                                              | System Response                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Client pay invoice online.                                                                                                                             | 2. System shows appointment details and balance     |
| 3. Client checks the payment amount and chooses to pay or part-pay the invoice and enters the account number, name, security number and other information | 4. System authenticates payment information         |
|                                                                                                                                                           | 5. If correct then system records paid or part-paid |

## Alternative Courses

**Step 2:** If payment information is incorrect then back to step 3 and display "payment unsuccessful" and use case ends.

## Errors:

- Is missing the following sections
	- Purpose
	- Preconditions
	- Postconditions
- Overview has spelling error "insure"
- Overview includes details that should have been included in Purpose and Precondition
- Overview mentions that the use case allows client to pay via different payment methods which are not present in the action steps
- Step 1 abstraction too high
- Step 2 mentions appointment details, not sure how this is related to payment
- Step 3 abstraction too low
- Requires `«extend»` at Step 3
- Alternative course refers to incorrect step, should refer to Step 4

# Use Case 2 Re-write:

## Use case: Payment

**Actor/s:** Client  
**Purpose:** This Use Case allows client to pay or part-pay an invoice online via selected payment method.  
**Overview:** Client selects to either pay or part-pay the invoice, and decides on payment method. If payment is made via credit card, system authenticates payment information. If payment is authenticated, the payment is recorded.  
**Preconditions:** The Use Case begins when the client purchases an insurance product.  
**Postconditions:** System provides client with payment methods. If payment is made via Credit Card, a successful payment is recorded by the system.

## Typical Course of Events

| 3. Client selects part payment *Extension Point:* Make full payment | 4. System displays payment method options |
| 5. Client selects payment via Credit Card and enters details *Extension Point:* Pay via cheque *Extension Point* Pay via cash | 6. System authenticates payment information |

## Alternative Courses: 

**Step 3:** If client selects full payment, continue with Step 4  
**Step 5:** If client selects Cheque payment method, system displays balance owing, business mailing address and business physical address, use case ends  
**Step 5:** If client selects Cash payment method, system displays balance owing and business physical address, use case ends  
**Step 7:** If payment details fail authentication, system displays "payment unsuccessful" and go to to Step 5, use case ends
