|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| `P(x):` | `Predicate`              | a statement with one or more variables, I see it as a function |

# Analogy with logic concepts

The laws are essentially the same, but are just presented differently.

`~(A ˅ B) ≡ ~A ˄ ~B` corresponds to `(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'`

| Logic   | Set  | Boolean |
|---------|------|---------|
| `~`     | `'`  | `'`     |         
| `˄`     | `∩`  | `•`     |
| `˅`     | `∪` | `+`     |
| `true`  | `U`  | `1`     |
| `false` | `∅`  | `0`     |

# Negations

## Statement Negations

| Statement   | Negation        |
|-------------|-----------------|
| All do...   | Some don't...   |
| All are...  | Some are not... |
| Some do...  | None do...      |
| Some are... | None are...     |

## Negation of `∀∃`

```
~(∀x ∈ P, ∃y ∈ M, S(x, y)) ≡ ∃x ∈ P, ∀y ∈ M, ~S(x, y)
```

## Negation of `∃∀`

```
~(∃y ∈ M, ∀x ∈ P, S(x, y)) ≡ ∀y ∈ M, ∃x ∈ P, ~S(x, y)
```

## Negation of `∃∃`

```
~(∃x ∈ P, ∃y ∈ M, S(x, y)) ≡ ∀x ∈ P, ∀y ∈ M, ~S(x, y)
```

## Negation of `∀∀`

```
~(∀y ∈ M, ∀x ∈ P, S(x, y)) ≡ ∃y ∈ M, ∃x ∈ P, ~S(x, y)
```

# Laws of Sets

The laws are in pairs, and can swap from a law to its dual (matching pair) by swapping `∪` with `∩`, and `U` with `∅`.

## Distributive Laws

```
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
```

## de Morgan's Laws:

```
(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
(A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'
```

# Power Sets

Is a collection of all the possible combinations of subsets, including `∅`, the empty set.

If `A = {1, 2, 3}` 

Then `P(A) = [`∅`, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}]`

Formula to work it out is `2^n`, where `n = number of subsets`

# Boolean Algebra Laws

## Laws for Multiplication

- `0 • 0 = 0` 
- `0 • 1 = 0` 
- `1 • 0 = 0`
- `1 • 1 = 1`

## Laws for Addition

- `0 + 0 = 0` 
- `0 + 1 = 1`
- `1 + 0 = 1`
- `1 + 1 = 1`

## Laws for Complementation

`0' = 1` `1' = 0`

## Idempotent Laws

- `a + a = a`
- `a • a = a`

## Complement Laws

- `a + a' = 1`
- `a • a' = 0`

## Involution Law

- `(a')' = a`

## Associative Laws

- `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`
- `(a • b) • c = a • (b • c)`

## Commutative Laws

- `a + b = b + a`
- `a • b = b • a`

## Distributive Laws

- `a + b • c = (a + b) • (a + c)`
- `a • (b + c) = a • b + a • c`

## de Morgan's Laws

- `(a + b)' = a' • b'`
- `(a • b)' = a' + b'`

## Identity Laws

- `a + 0 = a`
- `a • 1 = a`
- `a + 1 = 1`
- `a • 0 = 0`

# Fundamental Products

Formula to work out is how many fundamental products is `2^n`, where `n = number of variables`

There are two key concepts to remember:

- In a fundamental product, each variable must be present, with or without `'`
- Each fundamental product is equal to 1 for one and only one combination of the variables
