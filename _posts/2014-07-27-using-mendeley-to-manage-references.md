I've been looking around trying to find the best approach for me when it comes time to writing essays and decided to use [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) and markdown based tools rather than M$ Word. Since I am using git, I would prefer to keep my writing in plain-text format. 

As I was searching around on google, I came across [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com). From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeley):
>Mendeley is a desktop and web program for managing and sharing research papers, discovering research data and collaborating online. It combines Mendeley Desktop, a PDF and reference management application (available for Windows, OS X and Linux) with Mendeley Web, an online social network for researchers.

It also has the ability to sync directly to `.bib` files which can be used by LaTeX for citations.
