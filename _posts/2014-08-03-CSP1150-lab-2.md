# Java Fundamentals

## Task 1

Write a program that calculates tax and tip for a restaurant bill. 

- Meal $100
- Tax 6.75%
- Tip 15%

### Things To Remember

#### `Scanner` object

Importing `Scanner` has not yet been taught, but I wanted to add it anyway so found out the following:

- Imports happen before `class`.
- Use the imports inside `main`. 
	- In this case, a `Scanner` object called `sc`.
	- Note that `sc` uses `.close()` method to turn off the `Scanner` object once I'm done with it.
	- If `Scanner` isn't closed, it will continue running in the background and may create memory leaks.

``` java
// import scanner before class
import java.util.Scanner;
	// class
	public class RestaurantBill {
	// main method
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// create scanner object inside main
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		// ask for user input
		System.out.print("How much was dinner? $");
		// stores user input as a double into variable 'meal'
		double meal = sc.nextDouble();
		// close Scanner
		sc.close();
	}
}
```

#### Creating Methods

The results were up to 4 decimal places long. Not very handy in retail scenarios, so I wanted to have all prices rounded to 2 decimals. At first I did this procedurally, but since Java is `object-oriented`, I wanted to give that style a go. Plus, it saves me from having to type the code multiple times.

If the `method` is to be in the same `class`, do it outside `main`.

``` java
// class
public class RestaurantBill {
// create method that rounds result to two decimals
private static double roundTwo(double a) {
	return Math.round(a * 100.0) / 100.0;
}
	// main
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	double meal = 123.456;
	// calls roundTwo() with meal as argument
	System.out.println("Meal: $" + roundTwo(meal));
	}
}
```

#### Constants

I always forget about these. If something is never going to change, it is a constant. It should use the `final` keyword to protect it and `USE_CAPITALS` and underscores as names.

``` java
public class RestaurantBill {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// tax rate and tip rate are constants
		final double TAX_RATE = 6.75 / 100.0,
						TIP_RATE = 15 / 100.0;
	}
}
```

## Task 2

Write a program that calculates Joe's shady stock transactions.

- Joe bought 1000 shares
- Price per share $32.87
- Joe paid 2% commission

Two weeks later...

- Joe sold 1000 shares
- Price per share $33.92
- Joe paid 2% commission

Output must display the following.

- Amount that Joe paid for the stock
	- Amount of commission Joe paid
- Amount that Joe sold the stock for
	- Amount of commission Joe paid
- Display profit Joe made after selling, and paying the two commisssions.

### Things To Remember

Not much new here. Just created another method to calculate the commission. Saves me from having to type it out twice.

``` java
// class
public class StockTransaction {
// create method to calculate commission
private static double commissionCalc(double b, double c) {
	return b * c;	
}
	// main
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	final double COMMISSION = 0.02;
	double buyTotal = 32870;

	// calls commissionCalc, uses buyTotal and COMMISSION as args, stores result in buyCommission
	double buyCommission = commissionCalc(buyTotal, COMMISSION);
	}
}
```
