# What is Critical Thinking?

>Take the risk of thinking for yourself, much more hapiness, truth, beauty, and wisdom will come to you that way.

>Christopher Hitchens (2010)

- Employers want:
	- Team players
	- Critical thinkers
	- Anything else can be done with a training course
- Analysis:
	- What is it?
	- Critical thinking
	- Problem solving
	- Are people born with the ability to think critically, or can it be taught?

## Critical Thinking

- Critical thinking skills:
	- Reasoning
	- Evaluating
	- Problem solving
	- Decision making
	- Analysing

### The Kolb Cycle

- Concrete experience
- Observations and reflections
- Formation of abstract concepts and generalisations
- Testing implications of concepts in new situations
- Loop back to top

## Deductive Logic

### Logic

>a previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion.

>"if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true"

## Argument

- A statement (premise) that provides reason/s why a conclusion (claim) is supported
- Not all claims are supported by argument
- Not all arguments are valid
- An argument is a set of ordered statements that lead to conclusion
	- Premise/s
	- Reason
	- Conclusion

### Modus Ponens (MP)

- A valid argument form in logic
- Also known as "affirming the antecedent"
- The form of modus ponens is:
	- If `P`, then `Q`
	- `P`
	- Therefore, `Q`
	- `P → Q, P ├ Q`

### Example of MP

- If some property true of everything in a domain, then it is true of any particular thing in a domain
	- All humans are mortal
	- Socrates is a human
	- ∴ (Therefore,) Socrates is mortal

### How to Build an Argument

- Read the text
	- Find the conclusion
- Look for indicator words
	- For both premise and conclusions
	- Ensure indicator words are used in the sense of an argument, not in another sense
- Ask "what reasons are given for me to accept that this statement (the conclusion) is true?"

### But Things Can Still Go Wrong

- Logically true does not always mean factually true
- Valid and sound arguments:
	- Premise false, conclusion true
		- Unsound
	- Premise true, conclusion false
		- Invalid (form)

#### Good MP

- Cats are mammals
- Tigers are ~~cats~~ *members of the cat family*
- Therefore, tigers are mammals

#### Bad MP

##### Cats and Dogs

- Cats are mammals
- Dogs are mammals
	- Premise true
- Therefore, dogs are cats
	- Conclusion false

##### Cats and Tigers

- Cats are mammals
- Tigers are mammals
- Therefore, tigers are cats

#### False Premise, False Conclusion

- Cats are birds
- Dogs are birds
- Therefore, dogs are cats

#### False Premise, True Conclusion

- Cats are birds
- Birds are mammals
- Therefore, cats are mammals

### Types of Argument

Most valid at the top, and devolves to the bottom.

- Refuting the central point
	- Explicitly refutes the central point
- Refutation
	- Finds the mistakes and explains why it's mistaken using quotes
- Counterargument
	- Contradicts and then backs it up with reasoning and/or supporting evidence
- Contradiction
	- States the opposing case with little or no supporting evidence
- Responding to tone
	- Criticizes the tone of the writing without addressing the substance of the argument
- Ad hominem
	- Attacks the characteristics or authority of the writer without addressing the substance of the argument
- Name calling
	- "You're an ass hat"

## Another View of Critical Thinking Skills

- de Bono (1969) says that there are three types of problems
	- Those that can be solved with the processing of information
		- Logical problems
	- When the current state appears sufficient or optimal
		- Lateral problems
	- Problems that can be solved by re-structuring information
		- Lateral Problems

## Lateral Thinking

- What is the sum of the first one hundred counting numbers?
- How many ways can this be done?
- A German mathematician found a particularly unusualy way to calculate this sum without using a calculator
	- Gauss

## Review

- Define the following terms:
	- Analysis
		- Critical thinking
		- Problem solving
	- Critical Thinking
		- Reasoning
		- Evaluating
		- Problem solving
		- Decision making
		- Analysing
	- Lateral Thinking
		- Thinking outside the box
	- Premise
		- Statement
		- Provides background to argument
		- A tool for deductive logic
	- Argument
		- A statement (premise) that provides reason/s why a conclusion (claim) is supported
		- An argument is a set of ordered statements that lead to conclusion
			- Premise/s
			- Reason
			- Conclusion
		- Not all claims are supported by argument
		- Not all arguments are valid
