# Thesis Statements and Internet Information Literacy

>M. Brogan

## Generic Skills: Time Management

Regular status checks will help to keep you on track at university, avoid costly disasters and late submissions, and alleviate stress levels in the long term.

## Thesis Statements

### What is a Thesis Statement?

- A thesis statement (Tagg, 2004) is a statement of the point that you make in a piece of academic writing
	- In an assignment, a thesis or any form of academic writing
	- It is not a research question, but can be an answer to a question
	- A well written thesis statement is usually a single sentence that shapes the argument of a piece of academic writing
	- It also functions as a road map to a piece of academic writing

### Writing a Thesis Statement

The simplest form of thesis statement comes from combining a topic with a position

`TOPIC` Success in life `+` `POSITION` Success requires hard work

`=` `THESIS STATEMENT` You have to work hard to succeed in life.

More conventionally, we begin with a question forming the basis of an academic writing task.

### Thesis Statement Types

- The kind of thesis statement adopted depends on the purpose of the academic writing task (Tardiff & Brizee, 2011)
	- Argumentation
	- Analysis
	- Exposition

#### Argumentation

- Evidence based reasoning
	- It explains why retailers who do not become e-retailers will fail.

##### Example:

**Question:** What will happen to retailers who do not develop a viable online business model?

**Thesis Statement:** Retailers who do not devise a viable online business model will fail due to competition from online.

#### Analysis

- Questions aimed at exploring relationships often result in **analysis** type thesis statements
	- The resulting paper analyzes the relationship between spending and revenues, operationalizing the concept of online revenues as ROI.

##### Example:

**Question:** What is the relationship between spending on doing business online and online revenues?

**Thesis Statement:** Relative to businesses that spend less on e-business, firms that spend more derive greater ROI.

#### Exposition

- An expository (or explanatory) question seeks an explanation
- The question requires an explanation of the concept of business values with e-business
	- The resulting paper for this question would explore all the sources of business value connected with doing business online

##### Example:

**Question:** What sources of business values are associated with doing business online?

**Thesis Statement:** The principal sources of business value in doing business online are reduced costs, new markets and improved customer relations.

### Academic Tips

- A thesis statement is **not** set in stone
	- Will undergo change as your reading and thinking evolves
	- Do not be afraid to adjust or change your thesis statement
		- Only if your data collection or evidence gathering justifies it
- Conventionally, a thesis statement occurs at the end of the introduction or statement of background to the problem being investigated
	- With adjustments to suit the narrative

**Example:**

**Question:** What will happen to retailers who do not develop a viable online business model?

**Thesis Statement:** Retailers who do not devise an viable online business model will fail due to competition from online.

**Paper:** This paper explores the question of what happens to retailers who do not develop a viable online business model. It will be argued that retailers who do not devise a viable business model will fail due to competition from online.

### Exercise: Write a Thesis Statement

- Select one of the following topic areas:
	- Counter terrorism
	- Climate change
	- Policing
	- Sports science
	- Politics
- Develop argumentative, analytical and expository thesis statements for one of these topic areas

## Internet Information Literacy

- Information literacy is the *set of skills* needed to find, retrieve, analyze, evaluate and use information
	- Being web information literate begins with understanding the anatomy of the public domain web
- To be literate about public domain web you need to be literate about
	- Context
	- Authority
	- Information seeking

### Context and the Web

- On the web, stuff sits in the context of the domain
- A domain name is the name given to an internet web server, or host
	- ie. `ecu.edu.au`, `curtin.edu.au`, `brogan.id.au`
- A Domain Name Server (DNS) maps names to an IP address that uniquely identifies the host
	- ie. `127.0.0.1`, `253.16.44.22`, `72.48.108.101`
- These are examples of IPv4 addresses
	- IPv4 = 4 byte (32bit) addressing = 2^8 x 2^8 x 2^8 x 2^8 addresses
	- IPv6 = 128 bit addressing = 2^128 addresses
- In Australia, domain names are controlled by [auDA](http://www.auda.org.au/)
	- `.au` Domain Adminsitration Ltd (auDA) is the policy authority and industry self-regulatory body for the `.au` domain space
	- Since 2000, has officially administered the `.au` domain
- Each country has a registery controller like auDA
	- Singapore has Singapore Network Information Centre
- The controller decides what domains will be allowed
	- Top level domains contain no geographic info and have one suffix `.com`
	- Second level domains contain an additional level of qualification `.edu.au` or '.gov.au'
	- `.biz` `.info`
- In `.au`, the domain name registry is maintained by registry providers
- The domain name forms part of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to uniquely address web pages

### WHOIS

- Analyzing and using web information sources appropriately involves judgements about context
- `.com` `.biz` Market and advocate
- `.edu` `.asn` `.org` Inform and represent
- Scanning a URL can give you a lot of information before you waste time clicking on the link
- A reputable domain home page should have an `About` link that describes ownership and editorial practices
	- Authorship should be clearly attributed
- You can use a service like [WHOIS](http://whois.domaintools.com/) to discore more about a registered domain
	- Who owns or is responsible for internet content can involve multiple tools and isn't always transparent

#### WHOIS Exercise

- Using WHOIS lookup at [domaintools.com](http://whois.domaintools.com/) to find out more about the following domains
	- [nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/)
	- [huffingtonpost.com](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/)
	- [thewest.com.au](https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/)
	- [ecu.edu.au](http://www.ecu.edu.au/)
	- [wikileaks.org](http://wikileaks.org/)
- What information did you find
	- Who owns these domains?

### Authority and Trust

- Skills and knowledge that enable determination of whether an internet source can be trusted require undertanding of site certification
	- Site certificates are used to establish the credentials of `.com` and `.biz`
		- `.com` sites that host customer initiated financial transactions must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) type encryption and an SSL certificate

### Wikipedia

- Trusting web information sources also involves authenticating authorship
	- Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia based on user contributed content
	- Entries are authored collaboratively
		- Form of crowd sourcing
		- Web 2.0 service
- Students love Wikipedia because its free, comprehensive and content can be copied and pasted
	- How does Wikipedia attribute authorship for content?
	- How trustworthy is Wikipedia?
	- Should it be used in academic writing?
	- Summarize points for and against Wikipedia's use in academic writing

### Searching with Search Engines

- Academic writing prefers peer reviewed information sources found in academic journals for reasons of authority
	- A peer reviewed paper has undergone an Editorial process involving scrutiny of claims and supporting evidence
	- When preparing assignments, place greatest emphasis on locating peer reviewed work found in peer reviewed journals
- Many quality information sources also exist on the public domain web
	- Search engines and folksonomy based retrieval tools can be used to locate these resources
	- Smart searching involves careful consideration of search engine features, query design and results interpretation
- Scanning a URL can give you alot of information before you waste time on clicking the link
	- Most information seekers use a single search engine (ie. google), do not read the results past page 1 and click on the first 4 results
- Implications?
	- Not the benign force it once was
	- Commercial considerations changing the search engine giant
	- Be a smart information seeker and read the URLs and abstract in your results page

#### Search Engines

- Crawler based, they *crawl* or *spider* the web
	- Google
	- Bing
	- Yahoo
- Paid inclusion
	- Guarantees your website gets reviewed and/or indexed promptly
- Ad words
	- Keywords that businesses pay for inclusion on a first page result list
	- Appears at the top of the results list or in margins
	- Single click to the business paying for exclusive or non-exclusive use of the ad words
- Search engines
	- Organic vs. sponsored
	- Organic regular search engine results displayed by crawler-based search engines
	- Sponsored results are paid advertising
	- Google is both
- To correctly evaluate the results of each search
	- Discriminate between paid and unpaid results
	- Read the URL and abstract
	- Apply your understanding of how the results list is compiled

#### Using Google

- Results in Google are **not** just heirarchical according to relevancy
- Sometimes a paid inclusion site will come first
- Then by relevancy sorted according to PageRank
	- The proprietary algorithm that made Google the success it is today
	- A kind of crowd sourcing for searching in which pages with higher rank page come before pages with lesser rank

```
PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
```

### Searching Tips

- With queries you need to balance recall and precision
	- You get great recall with a few keywords
		- Lots of keyword matches
		- Lots of irrelevant results, poor precision
	- You can improve precision with
		- Advanced searching `boolean`
		- Phrased based searching
			- "information retrieval" rather than keywords search
		- Searching within results
	- You can improve recall by
		- Following popup suggestions for synonymous or related search terms
		- A natural language based system affected by
			- Synonymy
			- Polysemy
- Different search engines search differently
- Different databases search differently, lots of options
	- [Bing](http://www.bing.com/)
		- Microsoft's answer to Google
	- [Yippy](http://yippy.com/)
		- Formerly Clusty, results displayed as clusters
	- [Infotopia](http://www.infotopia.info/)
		- Academic search, sites authenticated
	- [Twurdy](http://www.twurdy.com/)
		- Don't think this exists any more, points to LoL site
	- [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)
		- Computational knowledge engine
		- Used by Siri iOS
- Smart information seekers
	- Use different search engines
	- Use advanced search in Google
	- Use `""` and nest within `()` to create search strings that are specific
	- Think about their search terms first and create keywords for major concepts and subject headings that may fall under these concepts
