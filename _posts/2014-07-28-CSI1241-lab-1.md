# Systems as Processess

The task was to select four systems out of a list of eight and model the major processes for each system, based on the following:

`input -> process -> output`

The systems I chose were:

- Website
- iPad app that measures aspects of Parkinson's Disease
- A Systems Analysis lecture
- A person holding a glass of water
