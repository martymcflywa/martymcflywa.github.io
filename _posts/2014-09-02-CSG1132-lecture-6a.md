# Writing Literature Reviews

>Juila Wexler, FHES Learning Advisor

## Recap

- So far we have
	- Gotten to know our topic
	- Become somewhat familiar with the literature available and the relevant themes through concept mapping
	- Began to define your specific research questions and provisional thesis statements
	- Now we need to write a literature review

## What is a literature review?

- A review of current literature on a particular topic or issue
- A comparison of different sources
- An identification of *gaps* in current research
- A critical evaluation and synthesis of the literature, **not** an annotated bibliography
- Your essay will join an on-going conversation about motivation in using social media, so you need to know what others have discovered or are currently exploring

<!--more-->

### Your literature review should

- Place your study in a historical perspective
- Evaluate promising research methods
- Define and limit the problem you are working on
- Identify the gap your research will fill
- It also justifies why your essay should be written

## Reading & research tips

- Read and consider titles & abstracts first
- Use *key terms* and *subjects* functions
- Use discipline-specific databases to narrow your scope
- Don't get lured in to informal/un-academic web sources
- Skim for what you need
	- Don't read carefully until later
- Note headings in articles
	- What type of info is covered?
- Systematically map your research journey out

## Research sources

- A good literature review contains a thoughtful balance of source types
	- Peer-reviewed journal articles
	- Reports
	- Internet resources
	- Scholarly books
	- Statistics
- Remember the 4 Rs:
	1. Recent
		- When was it published
	2. Reliable
		- Who wrote it
		- Do they use evidence
		- Is it biased
		- Who published it
	3. Readable
		- Can you understand it
		- Who is target audience
			- Scholars or the general public
	4. Relevant
		- Is it useful for your topic area

## Writing process

### 1: Define key sources

- Look for scholarship that
	- Covers your general topic area
	- Has attempted to grapple with the various elements of your research question
	- Is of landmark importance in your topic area
	- Justifies your own research study

### 2: Critical review for each article

1. Write down main ideas, themes and conclusions
2. Analyse these main elements and formulate criticisms, questions or doubts
3. How is this source relevant to your topic, and other texts you've found
4. Draft a brief summary of steps 1, 2 and 3
	- Ensure to include
		- The main idea of the study
		- Evidence presented
		- Your own criticisms
		- A statement about the study's relevance for your research

### 3: Compare and contrast

- Identify similarities/differences in author's viewpoints
- Criticise and compare aspects of methodology
- Highlight outstanding and/or landmark studies
- Identify gaps in research
	- Areas that need to be examined further
- Use colour-coding or another system to group sources together
	- Track themes as they emerge
	- Consider expanding a version of your concept map

### 4: Plan and draft

- What is crucial for your readers to know in order to set up your own study and the questions you want to answer?
- Start broad by outlining the general research area
	- Gradually narrow in on your specific topic area and question
- Work towards identifying the *gap* where your own study is positioned, and the justification for it

## Structure

Ideas read during research are incorporated into your review, which explains how they relate to each other and your thesis statement.

### Introduction

- Introduces the reader to your topic area, its significance, the purpose of the literature review and how it will be structured
- Include a roadmap of how you have decided to present your research
	- Will it be grouped by:
		- Theme
		- Order of publication date
		- Categorised by discipline

#### Introduction Example

>(Burton, 2010)

### Body

- Divided into sub-sections
- Each section will contain your critical reviews synthesised together into separate paragraphs
- Each paragraph has their own
	- Topic sentence
	- Body
	- Concluding / transition sentence
- Select relevant parts of your critical review summaries and weave them together into your literature review *story*

### Conclusion

- Restates the purpose of the literature review
- Briefly summarises the position of the main research aim in relation to current scholarship

## Vocabulary to indicate structure

>- While Rios (2012) **argues**..., Soha (2013) **claims** that...
- Recent studies by Rios (2012) and Soha (2013) both **show the effect of**... However, data collected by Hutchison (2014) **demonstrates** a trend in...
- Early attepts to understand user motivation... Many psychological studies **contributed** to... for example, Janes and Maak (1996). Hunt's theory of... (1997) **explained the role of**... but later Jamison (1999) **showed** that.... In more recent years/since the advent of..., research has uncovered the importance of...

## Explore examples provided

1. Identify the **topic** of each paragraph
	- Observe how sources have been woven together within each paragraph
2. **_Underline_** **structural vocabulary** specific to literature reviews
3. Examine how the **choice of sources** has been guided by the themes identified
4.  Try to find the transitions
	- Indicate them with a "*"
5. Note the different scope of each example
	- Which one type of **organisational structure** might you use as a model for your own literature review?
6. If there's time, begin drafting your own introduction, using themes identified in your concept mapping assignment
