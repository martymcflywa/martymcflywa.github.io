# Concept Mapping

## Background

A bricks and mortar business is contemplating a move into e-retailing of its products and services. It has sought the assistance of a business analyst to investigate the business case for this investment.

## Focus question

What are the elements of a business case for investment in e-retailing?

## Task

- Research literature on e-retailing and business case development using [Library One](http://ecu.summon.serialssolutions.com/) search
- In Cmap, prepare a concept map consisting of no more than 20 nodes that address the focus question

## Cmap final version

## Cmap preliminary version

I kinda went overboard here and forgot about the focus question and the node limit. But still found out some decent information about customer acceptance of websites.
