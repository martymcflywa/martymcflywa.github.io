## Who the f*ck is Marty?

Grew up in Sydney and followed a girl all the way to Perth where Marty now lives. He has previously studied Graphic Design and has dabbled in freelance work. Marty also has work experience as a Business Analyst for a local utility company where he did the 9 to 5 grind since relocating. 

Outside of work, Marty taught himself how to mix two records together hap-hazardly and managed to worm his way into permanent residency at a local nightclub for almost 10 years. He also managed to score a few regular annual gigs at some festivals, and was even featured on Triple J at 3am! But the indulgent, sleepless rockstar lifestyle finally caught up with him and Marty hung up the headphones in 2013.

Somewhere in-between the partying, Marty found more ways to waste time and played *a lot* of video games, in particular the Arma series. The game is open to modding and stumbled his way around creating 3D assets for the game and even dabbled in scripting which inspired him to get into programming.
Now Marty's decided to get a haircut and a *proper* job, preferrably somewhere in software or web development and signed up to go to Uni.
